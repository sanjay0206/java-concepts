### Java Text Data Handling: String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer

In Java, handling text data efficiently is crucial for many applications. Three classes commonly used for this purpose
are `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`. Each class has distinct characteristics and is used in different
scenarios based on performance and mutability requirements.

#### String

`String` in Java represents an immutable sequence of characters. Once a `String` object is created, its content cannot
be changed. Any operation that seems to modify a `String` actually creates a new `String` object.

##### Pros:

- **Thread-safe (immutable):** Suitable for use in multi-threaded environments where data integrity is crucial.
- **Predictable memory usage:** Immutability ensures consistent memory usage patterns.

##### Cons:

- **Inefficient for frequent string manipulation:** Each modification creates a new `String` object, leading to
  performance overhead.

##### Example:

```java
String str = "Hello";
str = str + " World"; // This creates a new string object
```

### StringBuilder

`StringBuilder` is a mutable alternative to `String`. It allows for efficient string manipulation, such as appending,
inserting, or modifying characters within the string, without creating new objects.

#### Pros:

- **Mutable:** Suitable for building or modifying strings dynamically.
- **Efficient:** For concatenating or manipulating strings in a loop or when dealing with frequent modifications.

#### Cons:

- **Not thread-safe:** If used in a multi-threaded environment, additional synchronization is required (
  use `StringBuffer` for thread safety).

#### Example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World"); // Efficiently modifies the existing StringBuilder object
```

### StringBuffer

`StringBuffer` is similar to `StringBuilder` in terms of mutability and efficient string manipulation. However, it is
thread-safe, meaning multiple threads can safely use a `StringBuffer` without the risk of data corruption.

#### Pros:

- **Mutable and thread-safe:** Suitable for multi-threaded applications.
- **Efficient:** For concatenating or modifying strings when thread safety is required.

#### Cons:

- **Slightly less efficient than `StringBuilder`:** Due to thread safety overhead. It's generally recommended for
  multi-threaded scenarios.

#### Example:

```java
StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");
buffer.append(" World"); // Efficiently modifies the existing StringBuffer object
```

### Choosing Between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer

When working with text data in Java, choosing between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer` depends on your
specific requirements and considerations regarding mutability, thread safety, and immutability.

- **Use `StringBuilder`:**
    - When you need to manipulate strings dynamically and thread safety is not a concern.
    - `StringBuilder` is the preferred choice due to its efficiency in such scenarios.

- **Use `StringBuffer`:**
    - If you require thread safety, especially in a multi-threaded environment.
    - `StringBuffer` ensures thread safety, making it suitable for multi-threaded applications.

- **Use `String`:**
    - When you need an immutable string, and you don't anticipate frequent modifications.
    - `String` objects are immutable, ensuring data integrity and predictability.

The choice between these classes ultimately depends on your specific use case and whether you prioritize mutability,
thread safety, or immutability in your application.
