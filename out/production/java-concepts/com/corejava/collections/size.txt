1. Vector = 10

4. HashMap = 16 (but with the default load factor of 0.75, only 12 can be populated before a resize will happen)

6. ConcurrentHashMap = 16
7. HashSet = 16 (it's  based on a HashMap)
8. LinkedHashSet = 16
9. TreeSet = empty

List size by default will be Integer.MAX_VALUE = 214,74,83,647
ie) 2147.48 million or  214.74 crores.
