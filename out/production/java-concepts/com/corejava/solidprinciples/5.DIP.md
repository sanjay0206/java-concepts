# 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Definition:** The Dependency Inversion Principle suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; instead, details should depend on abstractions.

**Example:**  Let’s consider an example involving Notification System

### Violation of DIP
In this example, the `NotificationService` class directly depends on concrete classes like `EmailService` and `SMSService`, making it difficult to extend or modify the types of notifications supported.

```java
class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String message) {
        // Send email
    }
}

class SMSService {
    public void sendSMS(String message) {
        // Send SMS
    }
}

// Adding WhatsAppService 
class WhatsAppService {
    public void sendWhatsAppMessage(String message) {
        // Send WhatsApp message
    }
}

class NotificationService {
    private EmailService emailService = new EmailService();
    private SMSService smsService = new SMSService();
    private WhatsAppService whatsAppService = new WhatsAppService(); // Now NotificationService is modified 

    public void notifyUser(String message) {
        emailService.sendEmail(message);
        smsService.sendSMS(message);
        whatsAppService.sendWhatsAppMessage(message);
    }
}
```
Here, when adding support for whatsapp notifications:
* The `NotificationService` class needs to be modified whenever a new notification type is added.
* It directly depends on the specific classes (`EmailService`, `SMSService`, and `WhatsAppService`).
* This makes the `NotificationService` tightly coupled to specific implementations, violating the Dependency Inversion Principle and making the class difficult to extend.

### Adherence to DIP
To adhere to DIP, we introduce an abstraction (`Notification`) and make both the `EmailService` and `SMSService` depend on this abstraction. The `NotificationService` will only interact with this abstraction, making it easy to add new notification methods in the future.

```java
// Abstraction
interface Notification {
    void send(String message);
}

// Low-level modules depending on abstraction
class EmailService implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        // Send email
    }
}

class SMSService implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        // Send SMS
    }
}

// High-level module depending on abstraction
class NotificationService {
    private List<Notification> notificationChannels;

    public NotificationService(List<Notification> notificationChannels) {
        this.notificationChannels = notificationChannels;
    }

    public void notifyUser(String message) {
        for (Notification channel : notificationChannels) {
            channel.send(message);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored version, `NotificationService` depends only on the `Notification` interface, and specific notification implementations (`EmailService`, `SMSService`, etc.) are injected into it. This way, adding new notification types or changing existing ones doesn't affect the high-level module, following the Dependency Inversion Principle.
