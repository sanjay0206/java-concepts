# SOLID Principles

In the world of software development, creating maintainable, flexible, and scalable code is a top priority.  To achieve this, software engineers often turn to design principles that guide them in writing clean and robust code. One such set of principles is the SOLID principles, which provide a framework for designing well-structured and maintainable object-oriented software.  In this article, we’ll delve into the SOLID principles and explore how they can be applied in Java, complete with practical examples.
