        Java Reflection is quite powerful and can be very useful. Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect
        classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc.
        at compile time. It is also possible to instantiate new objects, invoke methods and get/set field values
        using reflection. Spring uses bean configuration such as:

        <bean id="someID" class="com.example.Foo">
            <property name="someField" value="someValue" />
        </bean>

        When the Spring context processes this < bean > element, it will use Class.forName(String) with the argument
        "com.example.Foo" to instantiate that Class.

        It will then again use reflection to get the appropriate setter for the < property > element and
        set its value to the specified value.
        
    Advantages of Reflection:
    =========================

    -> Dynamic Class Loading: Reflection allows you to load and interact with classes at runtime, which can be useful in situations where you don't know the class names until your program is running.

    -> Introspection: You can examine the metadata of classes, including fields, methods, constructors, and annotations. This is particularly useful for libraries and frameworks that need to interact with user-defined classes.

    -> Generic Programming: Reflection is commonly used in generic programming to work with objects of unknown types, as you can inspect and manipulate objects without knowing their concrete types at compile time.

    -> Debugging and Testing Tools: Reflection can be useful for creating debugging and testing tools that can inspect and modify the internal state of objects for testing purposes.

    -> Frameworks and Libraries: Many Java libraries and frameworks, such as dependency injection frameworks (e.g., Spring), object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries (e.g., Hibernate), and serialization/deserialization libraries (e.g., Jackson), heavily rely on reflection to provide their functionality.

    Disadvantages of Reflection:
    ============================

    -> Performance Overhead: Reflective operations are slower than their non-reflective counterparts. This can have a significant impact on the performance of your application, especially when used in performance-critical code paths.

    -> Security Risks: Reflection can bypass access controls, such as private and protected members of classes. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if not used carefully, making your code more prone to malicious attacks.

    -> Lack of Compile-Time Safety: Reflection operates at runtime, which means that many errors and type-related issues are only discovered at runtime. This lack of compile-time safety can lead to hard-to-debug issues.

    -> Code Complexity: Code that heavily relies on reflection can become complex and harder to maintain, as it may involve a lot of boilerplate code and error-prone string-based operations.

    -> Compatibility Issues: Reflection can be problematic when dealing with changes to class structures, as it can lead to compatibility issues if the class structure changes but the reflection-based code remains unchanged.

    -> Limited Tool Support: Many Java tools and IDEs may not provide full support for refactoring and analyzing code that heavily uses reflection, making it harder to work with.
