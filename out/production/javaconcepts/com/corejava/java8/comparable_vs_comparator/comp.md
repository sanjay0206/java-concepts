# Sorting Employees with Comparable and Comparator

## Overview
In Java, when sorting objects like `Employee`, you have two main options: using `Comparable` or `Comparator`. This README explains the difference between these two approaches and when to use each.

### Comparable
- **Definition**: `Comparable` is an interface in Java that allows a class to implement its own natural ordering.
- **Example Scenario**: Sorting `Employee` objects based on their employee ID, where each employee object inherently knows its ID.
- **Use Case**:
  - When there's a single, intrinsic way to order objects.
  - When the sorting criterion is intrinsic to the object itself.
- **Implementation**:
  - The class whose objects need to be sorted (`Employee` in this scenario) implements the `Comparable` interface.
  - The class provides implementation for the `compareTo()` method, which defines the natural ordering.
  - Objects can then be sorted using methods like `Collections.sort()`.

### Comparator
- **Definition**: `Comparator` is an interface in Java that provides a way to define custom sorting logic separate from the object's class.
- **Example Scenario**: Sorting `Employee` objects based on different criteria like salary, department, or hire date, where these criteria may vary depending on the use case or user preference.
- **Use Case**:
  - When there are multiple sorting criteria or when sorting criteria may vary.
  - When you need to sort objects that you can't or don't want to modify (e.g., third-party classes).
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a separate class (e.g., `EmployeeComparator`) that implements the `Comparator` interface.
  - Implement the `compare()` method to define the custom sorting logic.
  - Objects can then be sorted using methods like `Collections.sort()` by providing an instance of the `Comparator`.

## Conclusion
- Use `Comparable` when defining a single, intrinsic ordering for objects.
- Use `Comparator` when defining multiple or external sorting criteria.
- The choice between `Comparable` and `Comparator` depends on the specific requirements and design of your application.
