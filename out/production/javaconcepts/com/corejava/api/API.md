# SOAP vs REST API Comparison

This API.md file provides a simplified comparison between SOAP and REST API in a tabular format.

| Criteria     | SOAP                                   | REST                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Acronym      | Simple Object Access Protocol           | Representational State Transfer      |
| Communication| Uses XML for communication              | Supports multiple formats like JSON, XML, HTML, etc. |
| Protocol     | Rigid and follows a specific set of standards | Flexible and doesn't enforce any strict standards |
| Messaging    | Relies on XML for message format and WSDL for service description | Uses JSON or XML for data interchange and doesn't require additional messaging |
| Statelessness| Stateful and can manage complex transactions | Stateless and manages simple transactions effectively |
| Overhead     | Heavy and has more overhead due to extensive XML messaging | Lighter and has less overhead due to the use of simpler formats like JSON |
| Performance  | Comparatively slower due to XML parsing | Faster due to lightweight messaging and simpler data formats |
| Error handling | Provides detailed error handling through standardized fault elements | Error handling varies and is often left to the developer's implementation |
| Security     | Offers built-in security features through WS-Security | Security is managed through HTTPS and is less complex compared to SOAP |
| Usage        | Commonly used in enterprise-level applications and in situations where security and reliability are critical | Preferred for mobile applications and in situations where scalability and performance are essential |
