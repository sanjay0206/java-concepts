# What is Spring MVC?
Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework within the Spring ecosystem used to build web applications. It follows the MVC design pattern to separate the application's concerns:

**Model**: Represents the application data and business logic.

**View**: The presentation layer, typically HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.

**Controller**: Handles user requests, processes them (possibly invoking services/business logic), and returns a response (usually a View or data).

## 1. Dispatcher Servlet

The **DispatcherServlet** is the central dispatcher for HTTP request handlers/controllers in Spring MVC.

### Key Characteristics:
- Front controller pattern implementation
- Receives all incoming requests
- Delegates requests to controllers
- Manages the workflow of a Spring MVC application

### Diagram:
```
[HTTP Request] ? [DispatcherServlet] ? [Handler Mapping] ? [Controller] ? [View Resolver] ? [View] ? [HTTP Response]
```

### Example:
```java
// No explicit configuration needed in Spring Boot - auto-configured
// Main entry point is the @SpringBootApplication class
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

## 2. Interceptors

Interceptors are components that intercept requests before they reach controllers and after they leave controllers.

### Key Characteristics:
- Part of Spring MVC (not Servlet API)
- Have access to HandlerMethod and ModelAndView objects
- Three callback methods:
    - **preHandle:** Before controller execution
    - **postHandle:** After controller execution but before view rendering
    - **afterCompletion:** After complete request is finished

### Diagram:
```
           preHandle
               ?
[Request] ? [Interceptor] ? [Controller] ? [Interceptor] ? [Response]
                                   ?           ?
                                   ?????????????
                                     postHandle/afterCompletion
```

### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
    
    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, 
                             HttpServletResponse response, 
                             Object handler) {
        // Executed before controller
        System.out.println("Pre Handle method");
        return true; // continue execution
    }
    
    @Override
    public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, 
                           HttpServletResponse response, 
                           Object handler, 
                           ModelAndView modelAndView) {
        // Executed after controller but before view rendering
        System.out.println("Post Handle method");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, 
                                HttpServletResponse response, 
                                Object handler, 
                                Exception ex) {
        // Executed after complete request is finished
        System.out.println("After Completion method");
    }
}

// Register interceptor
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    
    @Autowired
    private MyInterceptor myInterceptor;
    
    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(myInterceptor);
    }
}
```

## 3. Filters

Filters are part of the Servlet API (not specific to Spring) that can inspect or modify requests and responses.

### Key Characteristics:
- Operate at lower level than interceptors
- Can intercept all requests, including static resources
- Don't have access to Spring context
- Can modify request/response objects

### Diagram:
```
[Request] ? [Filter1] ? [Filter2] ? ... ? [Servlet] ? [Filter2] ? [Filter1] ? [Response]
```

### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyFilter implements Filter {
    
    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code
    }
    
    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, 
                         ServletResponse response, 
                         FilterChain chain) 
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Pre-processing
        System.out.println("Before filter");
        
        // Continue filter chain
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
        
        // Post-processing
        System.out.println("After filter");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code
    }
}

// No registration needed when using @Component in Spring Boot
```

## Execution Order

The complete flow with all components:

1. Servlet Filters (in order of registration)
2. Dispatcher Servlet
3. Handler Interceptors (**preHandle** in order)
4. Controller method
5. Handler Interceptors (**postHandle** in reverse order)
6. View rendering (if applicable)
7. Handler Interceptors (**afterCompletion** in reverse order)
8. Servlet Filters (in reverse order)

## When to Use Which?

| Feature                | Filter                         | Interceptor                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Level                  | Servlet                        | Spring MVC                      |
| Request Access         | ServletRequest/Response        | HttpServletRequest/Response     |
| Context                | No Spring context access       | Has Spring context access       |
| Usage                  | Security, logging, compression | Authentication, logging, audit  |

### Filters are better for:
- Request/response content modification
- Compression
- Security checks that don't need Spring context

### Interceptors are better for:
- Spring-aware pre/post processing
- Authentication/authorization that uses Spring services
- Manipulating model attributes before/after controller execution
